# Pixel Art Generator - Vanilla Javascript Project

## Description

# Pixel Art Generator

This project is a Pixel Art Generator built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. It allows users to create their own pixel art in a grid that can be up to 35x35 cells. Users can choose their own colors and draw on the grid to create unique pixel art designs. Once a design is complete, users have the ability to save their creation as a screenshot for future use or sharing. This project is a fun and creative tool for anyone interested in pixel art or digital design.

## Usage
